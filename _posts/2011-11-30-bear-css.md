> Bear CSS is a handy little tool for web designers. It generates a CSS template containing all the HTML elements, classes & IDs defined in your markup.

A rather snazzy tool designed & developed by fellow Masters student [Kyle Gawley][] with illustrations from [Jordan Henderson][]. Upload an HTML file and it'll generate the CSS to let you style it. Pretty impressive stuff.
