Symbolset is a rather awesome semantic font (soon to be collection of fonts) for use on the web and elsewhere. What's so awesome about it? Write twitter and get the twitter icon. If a browser doesn't support the font, then they get the word twitter, as opposed to a random character. Awesome stuff. $30. Sold. Get yours now.
