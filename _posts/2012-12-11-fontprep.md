@font-face is an amazing tool for providing custom fonts on the web. There are a couple of ways to do add fonts to a site. The first is by usng a service like TypeKit to serve the fonts for you. The second is to use a service like FontSquirrel to convert them for you. FontPrep is a Mac App that lets you do this from the comfort of your computer, all for a mere $5. Sold.
