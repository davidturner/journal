I've decided to start revisiting some of my old [365 Design Blog][1] pieces. I'll be doing this for a couple of reasons. The most notable of these is to provide me with a space in which I can cover the details of the material I have been producing in a bit more detail that I have afforded elsewhere. It will also allow me to revisit some old pieces and address flaws in them, if any exist, and to update my code.

It will also allow for visitors to my site to see a bit more about what I do, the thought process I take when doing it, and also most importantly, the *why* I do it. I'll be looking over the various demos I have uploaded already over the next few days, so expect there to be new bits and pieces popping up here shortly.
