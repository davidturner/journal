> Wee_ is simple for a developer to use, but requires a little explanation when used by someone without that background. To that effect, I've put together a little post on the basics of Wee_ as I learn how to use it for both my developing freelance site and my portfolio remake.

Tami Olsen is an author and games developer, who has been spending some time getting to grips with how to use Wee_ CMS, a personal project of mine. Her post on the topic serves as a good starting point for getting to grips with the newly released version of [Wee_ CMS][].
