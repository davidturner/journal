> CodeKit automatically compiles Less, Sass, Stylus & CoffeeScript files. It effortlessly combines, minifies and error-checks Javascript. It even optimizes images, auto-reloads your browser and lets you use the same files across many projects. And that's just the first paragraph.

A fantastic app for developers and designers alike, currently in beta. If you like making your life easier, and happen to use an Apple Computer, you should go get this *now*. And then, when it's available on the App Store, you should buy it.

If you just care about compiling .less files on your Mac, you should check out [LESS.app][1], developed by the same guy.
