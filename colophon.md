This portfolio of work and journal exists for a single goal - to give myself an online presence with which to showcase my work and share my thoughts with my fellow developers and designers.

## Web Standards

This site has been developed with HTML5 and CSS3, the next iterations of the HTML and CSS specifications, allowing me to mark up and style content without hasty hacks.

Unfortunately, certain browsers don't support many aspects of HTML5 and CSS3 (Internet Explorer, looking at you here). Fortunately JavaScript provides a simple workaround for the *important* aspects of the site.

An added bonus of using these technologies is that I am able to style my content to suit the device that is accessing the site. This means that the site fits the device, rather than making the device fit the site.


## Browser Support

The site itself is designed to work well in as broad a selection of browsers as possible. The experience across some of them will be different. Older versions of Internet Explorer don't support @media queries for example. I've also dropped support for some older browsers as the only hits I ever get from them are me *testing* the site in them. I see no reason to support something that isn't used on my site. As such, browser support stands at:

- Internet Explorer 6 and above (IE6 & IE7 don't like percentages a whole lot, they needed some *special* treatment)
- Firefox 3.6 and above (should work in Firefox 3 and above, but untested)
- Chrome 13 and above (and probably older versions too)
- Opera (every version I've Tried)
- Safari 5 and above

In addition to desktop browsers I have made use of @media queries to provide a suitable experience to every browser capable of using them. This includes desktops, but also expands into the area of tablet and mobile devices. I've only been able to test this on iPhone, iPad, and Android devices, but it *should* carry across most competing products as well.

## Content Management

This site is powered by the all-seeing, all-knowing, static site generator [Jekyll][4].

## Hosting

Hosting for my portfolio, along with many of my other projects, is provided by the wonderful people at [BigWetFIsh][]. I can *heartily* recommend their services, they have never once let me down.
